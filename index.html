        <h2>Jonniesofa and his Races</h2>
		<hr class="small">
		<p class="jonnietext">This horse will always have an impact on the Houghton family for many reasons. Horse racing has been part of the family for a long time and from a young age Dad went to watch horse racing with his Dad. Dad has passed it down to his children and therefore Jonnesofa is very close to the family.
		Jonnesofa was never meant to be a winning horse but it was a dream for Dad to own a race horse and to see it race. Jonnie, in a way, is a dream completed for Dad and so I thought I'd recap his successes below with replays of all the races 
		for everyone to watch.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">His First Race</h2>
            <p class="lead">Jonniesofa ran his first race at Carlisle on 22nd of October 2015. Jonniesofa was at 7-1 compared to the favourite Western Miller who was at the odds of 4/5. This was Jonniesofa's first race on a racecourse but had run in plenty of point to points in Ireland before this race. Jonniesofa chased the leaders the whole way before being pushed along 3 furlongs out and losing 2nd place to Tickenwolf and managed to get 3rd place in the race.</p>

              <h2 class="featurette-heading">His Second Race</h2>
              <p class="lead">Jonniesofa moved onto Kelso where he came into the race as 2nd favourite against a horse called Western Rules. Western Rules was a clear favourite as 1/4 odds while Jonnie was running at 5/1 odds. Jonnesofa made all and was ridden before last furlong but managed to keep on well against the heavy favourite. This would be Jonniesofa's first win. </p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">His Third Race</h2>
          <p class="lead">After Kelso, Jonnie went to Newcastle and for the first time, had a change for jockey. Jonniesofa would have Ruby Walsh riding him and therefore Jonniesofa's odds went to 6-1 with the heavy favourite at 2-1, Jonniesofa stood a good chance of winning the race. Jonniesofa led to 3rd last furlong and then pressed leader after the 3rd last, he then led again approaching 2 out but was soon hard pressed and rideen but Jonnesofa kept on to beat Delusionofgrandeur but failed to beat Ballydine. </p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">His Fourth Race</h2>
            <p class="lead">Jonniesofa again ran at Newcastle in a 5 horse race which he was the clear favourite at 4/9 odds. Second favourite was Deputy Commander at 11/4 odds. Jonnie made all and drew clear. He was unchallenged the entire race and came into the line at a canter. He won the race by 41 lengths to second place and 65 lengths to third place.

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">His Fifth Race</h2>
          <p class="lead">Jonnie, after his win at Newcastle, went to Catterick where he was racing only 11 days after his win at Newcastle, Delusionofgrandeur would make another appearence in this race who was 2nd favourite at 5/2. Jonniesofa came into the race at 15/8 favourite but during the race he was driven along 2 furlongs out and narrowly lost to Delusionofgrandeur. The video is not long and is not the best for the Catterick race since it started late. </p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">His Haydock Race</h2>
            <p class="lead">Jonnesofa would now be racing in a Graded race at Haydock. The race was a class 1 race and grade 2 meaning that Jonniesofa was way out of his depth. Jonnie came into the race at 8/1 odds with only one other horse at worse odds compared to Jonniesofa. This race have the heavy favourite Duke Des Champs who was at the odds of 10/11 and BayWing at 7/2. Jonniesofa tracked the leaders the whole way round the course keeping in touch of the lead, coming to the last Jonnie stayed on well in the final 100 yards to beat out Vintage Clouds for his first Graded win.</p>
